My initial goal was to upload my assignments for all 61 courses of the ECE department of the National Technical University of Athens that I have attended .
However , during the first 3 semesters , I was not provident enough to save my assignments.Therefore , I am in no position to upload anything regarding the 20 courses of the first 3 semesters.
In addition , a few random assignments are also missing , because my computer crashed and I was not able to recover the data. In fact, all of my assignments should be missing right now , but I managed to recover most of them from facebook conversations!
Moreover , I have uploaded only my solutions for the assignments , not the assignments themselves. I have realized that this may be a problem , but I suppose that they can be retrieved by visiting mycourses.ntua.gr and the respective proffesor sites. It is also possible to ask other students of my class as well of course.

PS: Feel free to contact me if you need any help with your NTUA ECE courses ! I have written tutorials for every single course!
